‚ö†Ô∏è Beware !! You will need to have [Expose Run/Debug ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/27239-expose-run-debug?noRedirect=true) Jetbrain Rider Plugin installed on your Rider IDE. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration documentation

`Base Url` -> Its the IP address of the Rider IDE instance you want to target ( localhost or 127.0.0.1 by default since you mainly want to target your own machine )

`Port` -> Its the port of the Rider IDE instance you want to target ( ‚ö†Ô∏è this should match the exposing port in the [Expose Run/Debug ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/27239-expose-run-debug?noRedirect=true) plugin settings of your Rider IDE )

`Execution Type` -> Its the type of execution you want ( Officialy only debug is available for godot in GDScript, but run is also available for C# )

`Config to Execute` -> Its the name of the run/debug config you want to execute ( by default its Player GDScript, because its the one Rider with the Godot plugin set, but it can be changed, like the port it should match on both side )
